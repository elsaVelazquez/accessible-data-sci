# accessible-data-sci
For folks with disabilities who know they can still be data scientists (takes one to know one, takes one to show one how)

 The examples shown in this repo are cobbled together from different Python and Data Sci boot camps so are, like any code, ripped off code that is molded into my own work.  
## However, the arrangement and presentation of this info in an accessible way is 
# definitely 
# MY ORIGINAL WORK, and could only be done by someone like me.  
And there is only one me.  

I have 9 years of teaching elementary school (mostly kindergarten to bilingual children), and my master's degree is in Education.  I got a BS in Comp Sci through CU Boulder's Engineer program at age 42 in the Fall of 2020.  I have identified the gaps in teaching and aim to bridge them here.  This repo is for me, but you are welcome to use it if you think it will help you.
